    "text": "Brief Explanations\nIn this section, I briefly comment on each file. I assume you are familiar with\n\nR, Rstudio & renv\nDocker\nVSCode and its Remote-Containers extension\n\nI manage data files by DVC. But if you have another strategy for data management, ignore these parts.\n\nDockerfile\nFROM rocker/verse\n\nRUN apt update && apt install -y gnupg openssh-client libpoppler-cpp-dev\n\n# DVC\nRUN wget \\\n       https://dvc.org/deb/dvc.list \\\n       -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dvc.list && \\\n    wget -qO - https://dvc.org/deb/iterative.asc | apt-key add - && \\\n    apt update && \\\n    apt install -y dvc \n\n# R Packages\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('languageserver', 'renv'))\"\n\n# Rstudio Global Options\nCOPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio .config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json\n\nR image\nIf you don’t have any preferences, I recommend you use one of the rocker image series of rocker-org:\n\nrocker/rstudio\nrocker/tidyverse\nrocker/verse\nrocker/geospatial\n\nBecause I currently write a paper by Rmarkdown, I usually use rocker/verse and use rocker/geospatial for spatial analysis.\n\n\nDVC\nI just follow the official guide for Install from repository. If your environment includes python, it is easier to install it via pip.\n\n\nR packages\nI use renv for dependency management. languageserver allows us to run a code in VSCode, but I don’t usually use it.\n\n\nRstudio Global Options\nWhen Rstudio launches, it loads the ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json file for general settings. So I prepare /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json, and it allows me to use Rstudio with my favorite settings.\nIf you want to use your own settings, I recommend you\n\nOpen Rstudio\nSet up by GUI (Tools -&gt; Global Options)\nCopy ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in container)\nPaste it on /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in host)\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - RENV_PATHS_CACHE=/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - $HOME/.renv:/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n\nDISABLE_AUTH=true\nYou don’t need to type a password for each new session.\n\n\nCache for renv\nBy setting the RENV_PATH_CACHE and mounting the directory, you don’t need to re-install packages. In other words, you can share packages with other (docker) projects and don’t have to re-install all the packages when you rebuild a container.\nHave fun!"

During these three years, I have been trying to make my environment more minimal and portable so that I can set up, modify, and deliver (to AWS, GCP, etc.) my environment as easily as possible.\nHere is the GitHub template  for this environment.

This is because installing R and Rstudio on Linux is more complicated than installing Python or Julia. If you look at the Dockerfile in my template, you will see that installing Python and Julia is quite easy. Hence, I think it is best to use the rocker image since R is required anyway."

However, it does not have renv, I manually install it in the Dockerfile. Only if you use geospatial packages, you may want to use rocker/geospatial instead.\nThe renv is the best package manager for R, in my opinion. You can record the packages you installed by renv::snapshot() in renv.lock file. Then, you can reproduce the same environment by renv::restore() in other computers. If you are interested in renv, please refer to my previous workshop.\n\n\nPython\nI usually use Python only for DVC, so I don’t care much about the version. I install the latest version that can be installed with apt. In case that I need to use Python for analysis (e.g., scraping or natural language processing), I manage the version of the packages by pip and requirements.txt.\n\npip install -r requirements.txt for installation\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt for recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I manage the packages by requirements.txt?\n\n\n\nAs of September 2023, I think the virtual environment of Python is in chaos. For example, there are various tools such as venv, anaconda, pyenv, poetry, and rye, and I don’t know which one is the best and long-lasting. To be honest, I think pip install -r requirements.txt and pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt are enough because we are building the environment with Docker. However, I am not a researcher mainly using Python, so please let me know if there is any misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\nJulia\nYou can specify the version of Julia in the Dockerfile by ENV JULIA_MINOR_VERSION=1.9 and ENV JULIA_PATCH_VERSION=3. From my experience, Julia has been updated to be faster, but I have not encountered any bugs. Therefore, I usually specify the latest version and keep updating it during the project.\nFor the package management of Julia, I use Project.toml. The workflow is as follows.\n\nCreate an empty Project.toml file\nActivate the environment by Pkg.activate()\nInstall the packages by Pkg.add(\"Package Name\"), which automatically updates Project.toml\nWhen you clone the project, activate the environment by Pkg.activate() and install the packages by Pkg.instantiate()\n\n\n\nOther Softwares & Settings\n\nopenssh-client is required for SSH communication with GitHub from the container\nSince DVC is a Python package, I add ~/.pip/bin to the PATH\nI change the permission of the cached packages. This is because when you mount Docker Volumes, the packages are created with root permission, and you cannot write them with user permission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Git & GitHub in the container\n\n\n\nSince I work in the container environment, I want to run git pull and git push in the container. To do so, you need to move the SSH key for the GitHub from the host environment to the container. This can be done by adding the key to ssh-agent. With the Remote Containers feature, you can use the key inside of the container automatically. The settings are different for each host OS, so I recommend reading the section “Sharing Git credentials with your container” in the official documentation of Developping inside a container.\nI use Windows WSL as the host OS, so I add the following to ~/.bash_profile. The difference from the official documentation is that I added ssh-add at the end.\n\n\n~/.bash_profile\n\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nif [ -z \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" ]; then\n   # Check for a currently running instance of the agent\n   RUNNING_AGENT=\"`ps -ax | grep 'ssh-agent -s' | grep -v grep | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]'`\"\n   if [ \"$RUNNING_AGENT\" = \"0\" ]; then\n        # Launch a new instance of the agent\n        ssh-agent -s &&gt; $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent\n   fi\n   eval `cat $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent`\nfi\nssh-add $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/rstudio/.pip\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - renv:/home/rstudio/.cache/R/renv\n            - pip:/home/rstudio/.pip\n            - julia:/home/rstudio/.julia\n            - TinyTeX:/home/rstudio/.TinyTeX\n            - fonts:/usr/share/fonts\nvolumes:\n  renv:\n    external: true\n  pip:\n    external: true\n  julia:\n    external: true\n  TinyTeX:\n    external: true\n  fonts:\n    external: true\nThe most important point is that I mount the renv cache to the host’s Docker Volumes. This means that once you install the R packages, they will be saved on the host side. Therefore, you don’t need to install R packages every time you build the Docker. Also, when you use Docker environments for multiple projects, you don’t need to install the same packages multiple times. The same is true for Julia, Python, and TinyTeX packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Docker Volumes?\n\n\n\nDocker Volumes is a mechanism for storing Docker container data on the host side. This allows you to keep the data even if you delete the container. Unlike the binding mount, the data is stored in hidden folders on the host side and optimized for Docker, so it is faster than the binding mount. When you use this template for the first time, you need to create Docker Volumes by the following command.\ndocker volume create renv\ndocker volume create pip\ndocker volume create julia\ndocker volume create TinyTeX\ndocker volume create fonts\nIn some articles on the Internet (including my previous post), the author binding-mounts package caches into the host area directly, such as ~/.cache/R/renv. This is not recommended since the file system of MacOS and Windows (except WSL2) is different from Linux (Docker). The bind mounts may significantly slow down the execution of the package."

However, there is a very light and convenient package called tinytex in R2, so I will use it.\n\nWhat is TinyTeX?\nTinyTeX is a super lightweight distribution of \\(\\LaTeX\\). It automatically installs missing packages and compiles them, so you don’t need to install a large number of packages in advance to build a \\(\\LaTeX\\) environment. This is why TinyTeX is used by default when compiling PDFs with Rmarkdown or Quarto. This lightness is very compatible with the Docker environment, and it is also adopted in the rocker/verse image. In this template, I will use TinyTeX as the \\(\\LaTeX\\) compiler in VSCode. Also, the \\(\\LaTeX\\) packages installed at this time are cached in Docker Volumes.\n\n\nInstalling TinyTeX and Setting in VSCode\nWhen installing TinyTeX, there is an R command called tinytex::install_tinytex(). However, since I want to cache the packages installed with TinyTeX in Docker Volumes, I specify the installation folder as follows.\ntinytex::install_tinytex(dir = \"/home/rstudio/.TinyTeX\", force = TRUE)\nNote that once you install it in Docker Volumes, you don’t need to run this command again in other Docker projects.\nTo use TinyTeX as the \\(\\LaTeX\\) compiler in VSCode, edit settings.json as this. Note that if you set it in WORKSPACE_DIR/.vscode/settings.json, it will only be valid for this workspace. Since the .vscode/settings.json is often git-ignored in team projects, I have renamed it to _settings.json in the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I don’t use Overleaf?\n\n\n\nOverleaf is probably the first candidate for \\(\\LaTeX\\) editors, however, I don’t use Overleaf for the following reasons.\n\nIn the free version, Overleaf cannot be linked with GitHub\nGitHub branches cannot be separated\nIf I want to modify the appearance of figures and tables in slides and papers, I have to upload them every time\nThe number of files is limited to a maximum of 2000 files per project\nSometimes the service goes down. This is fatal if it is before the deadline\nIt is a waste of time to use an editor that cannot use GitHub Copilot or any other AIs 🫠\n\nI think the setup with TinyTeX and VSCode’s LaTeX Workshop extension is not so difficult, and the compilation is (usually) faster on your local computer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Japan ranks 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2023, well below many developed countries, and has one of the largest gender pay gaps among high-income countries. On the other hand, women’s labor force participation is high in Japan. However, women are much more likely to work in non-regular jobs, which are associated with lower wages and fewer hours. Men, in contrast, have regular, higher-paid jobs with long-hours requirements. In this paper, I build and estimate a model where couples jointly decide their occupations and working hours. Occupations differ in their flexibility. Regular jobs require long working hours, and hourly wages are a convex function of hours worked. Non-regular occupations have a linear mapping between hours worked and hourly wages. The model also allows for social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands. Given the inflexibility of regular jobs and social norms, women are more likely to choose non-regular jobs or not to work, and allocate a larger share of their hours for home production. The model can account for all of the observed gender gaps in labor force participation, 33% in occupational choices, 74% in labor hours, and 34% in wages. Through the lens of the model, the inflexibility of regular jobs explains almost all the gaps in occupational choices and wages, while social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands account for all of the gap in the participation rate and half of the gap in hours worked."

Through the lens of the model, the inflexibility of regular jobs explains almost all the gaps in occupational choices and wages, while social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands account for all of the gap in the participation rate and half of the gap in hours worked."

We develop an estimation algorithm and adapt existing econometric results to provide its theoretical justification. We apply these tools to Dutch administrative data to study individual heterogeneity in the child-penalty (CP) context in three ways. First, we document significant heterogeneity in the individual-level CP trajectories, emphasizing the importance of going beyond the average CP. Second, we use individual-level estimates to examine the impact of childcare supply expansion policies. Our approach uncovers nonlinear treatment effects, challenging the conventional policy evaluation methods constrained to less flexible specifications. Third, we use the individual-level estimates as a regressor on the right-hand side to study the intergenerational elasticity of the CP between mothers and daughters. After adjusting for the measurement error bias, we find the elasticity of 24%. Our methodological framework contributes to empirical practice by offering a flexible approach tailored to specific research questions and contexts.

This is the reason why I used to use xaringanthemer, which automatically generates the ggplot2 theme corresponding to the slides’ theme. Unfortunately, there have been no packages for Quarto slides (as far as I know), I declare this theme_quarto() function.\n\n\nCode\nblend_colors &lt;- function(x, y, alpha = 0.5) {\n  x &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(x)\n  y &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(y)\n  z &lt;- colorspace::mixcolor(alpha, x, y)\n  colorspace::hex(z)\n}\ncolor_blender &lt;- function(x, y) function(alpha = 0.5) blend_colors(x, y, alpha)\ntheme_quarto &lt;- function (\n    text_color = color_text,\n    background_color = color_bg,\n    text_font = font_text,\n    text_font_size = 30,\n    accent_color = color_base,\n    title_font = font_title,\n    title_font_size = 30\n){\n    blend &lt;- color_blender(text_color, background_color)\n    ggplot2::theme(\n        line = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.2)),\n        rect = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = background_color),\n        title = ggplot2::element_text(\n            color = accent_color,\n            family = title_font,\n            size = title_font_size\n        ),\n        plot.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.8),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.9),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8),\n        axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.8)),\n        axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(color = blend(0.4), size = title_font_size * 0.7),\n        legend.key = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n        legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8, family = title_font),\n        plot.caption = ggplot2::element_text(\n            size = text_font_size * 0.8,\n            color = blend(0.3)\n        )\n    )\n}\n\n\nWhile the original xaringanthemer::theme_xaringan() redefines the primary color of ggplot2::geom_* by ggplot2::update_geom_defaults, my function does not. I did not overwrite it because color palettes must be specified manually for 2+ color cases, anyway. You can use it like:\n\ncolor_base &lt;- \"#1C5253\"\ntb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe most famous way to highlight plots should be gghighlight. You can proceed with your stories smoothly and clearly by\n\n\n\nFirst Slide\n\np &lt;- tb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_col(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Slide\n\np + gghighlight(x == \"Japan\")"
