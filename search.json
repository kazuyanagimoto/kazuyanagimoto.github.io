    "text": "Brief Explanations\nIn this section, I briefly comment on each file. I assume you are familiar with\n\nR, Rstudio & renv\nDocker\nVSCode and its Remote-Containers extension\n\nI manage data files by DVC. But if you have another strategy for data management, ignore these parts.\n\nDockerfile\nFROM rocker/verse\n\nRUN apt update && apt install -y gnupg openssh-client libpoppler-cpp-dev\n\n# DVC\nRUN wget \\\n       https://dvc.org/deb/dvc.list \\\n       -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dvc.list && \\\n    wget -qO - https://dvc.org/deb/iterative.asc | apt-key add - && \\\n    apt update && \\\n    apt install -y dvc \n\n# R Packages\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('languageserver', 'renv'))\"\n\n# Rstudio Global Options\nCOPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio .config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json\n\nR image\nIf you don’t have any preferences, I recommend you use one of the rocker image series of rocker-org:\n\nrocker/rstudio\nrocker/tidyverse\nrocker/verse\nrocker/geospatial\n\nBecause I currently write a paper by Rmarkdown, I usually use rocker/verse and use rocker/geospatial for spatial analysis.\n\n\nDVC\nI just follow the official guide for Install from repository. If your environment includes python, it is easier to install it via pip.\n\n\nR packages\nI use renv for dependency management. languageserver allows us to run a code in VSCode, but I don’t usually use it.\n\n\nRstudio Global Options\nWhen Rstudio launches, it loads the ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json file for general settings. So I prepare /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json, and it allows me to use Rstudio with my favorite settings.\nIf you want to use your own settings, I recommend you\n\nOpen Rstudio\nSet up by GUI (Tools -&gt; Global Options)\nCopy ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in container)\nPaste it on /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in host)\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - RENV_PATHS_CACHE=/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - $HOME/.renv:/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n\nDISABLE_AUTH=true\nYou don’t need to type a password for each new session.\n\n\nCache for renv\nBy setting the RENV_PATH_CACHE and mounting the directory, you don’t need to re-install packages. In other words, you can share packages with other (docker) projects and don’t have to re-install all the packages when you rebuild a container.\nHave fun!"

Save the tinytable object as a PDF file.\ntt_count |&gt;\n  save_tt(file.path(dir_post, \"img\", \"table_count.pdf\"),\n          overwrite = TRUE)\ntinytable::save_tt() is a powerful funtion that can save the tinytable object as a PDF file. If the file extension is .pdf, the function compile it as a single PDF file by tinytex package.\n2. Convert the PDF file to a SVG file.\n\n```{bash}\n#!/bin/bash\npdf2svg img/table_count.pdf img/table_count.svg\n```\n\npdf2svg is a command line tool that converts a PDF file to a SVG file. And importantly, knitr can run the bash script in a code chunk."

    "text": "Last Comments\nIn this post, I introduced the tinytable package, which is a gamechanger of creating tables in R. In the wrangling process, I firmly believe that tinytable is more flexible and powerful than kableExtra and gt for the following reasons:\n\nCovers almost all the features of kableExtra and gt & gtExtras. You can use multirow & multicolumn, highlight cells, format cells, and mathematical expressions\nAllows to export tables not only in HTML and LaTeX but also in PDF (with tinytex) and Typst\nCompiles faster than kableExtra and gt. I think this is because tinytable is a small package that only uses baseR\n\nHave a happy R life 🥂!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "{targets} is an R package for building research workflows. Its primary feature is managing R objects (data, functions, and results) and their dependencies, automatically recalculating downstream objects when upstream objects change. This allows you to maintain reproducibility throughout your research process.\nWhen combined with Quarto, you can manage all aspects of your research workflow in a single pipeline—from interim reports and slides to writing the final manuscript. This article explains a Quarto + {targets} research workflow I actively use in my own research. While the final pipeline is a clean and simple workflow, I also add flexibility for experimentation and iteration.\nThe code is available here.

All inputs that the function depends on must be specified, and the output must be a file or object. This makes dependencies explicit.\n\nConceptually, you start with files, read them to create objects, and then use those objects to run functions that create new objects.

Experiment with Data Analysis and Models\nCreate notebook-style posts in the playground directory of your website to experiment with data analysis and models.\nYou can load cleaned data with tar_load().

Most analyses in the experimental stage won’t make it into the final paper. Including them in the pipeline makes dependency management unnecessarily complex. Instead, experiment in the playground directory and only incorporate essential elements into the pipeline.\nBy combining tar_quarto() with Quarto’s freeze: auto setting, results are not recomputed unless you manually compile them. While this means that dependent parts won’t recalculate when upstream changes occur, it has the benefit of minimal management for unnecessary parts. If upstream changes do occur, you can manually recompile only the necessary parts of the project."

I define functions like compute_*() that take cleaned data as arguments and return calculated results as numbers or data frames. I don’t create figures here—I do that within the manuscript.\nFor LaTeX users, you might want to save figures at this stage. For example:\ntar_plan(\n  tar_file(\n    fig1_file,\n    plot_fig1(data1, here_rel(\"path\", \"to\", \"file\", \"fig1.pdf\"))\n  )\n)\n\nplot_fig1 &lt;- function(data1, path_fig1) {\n  ggplot(data1, aes(x = col1, y = col2)) +\n    geom_point()\n  \n  ggsave(path_fig1)\n  return(path_fig1)\n}\n\n\nIncorporate Julia Code into the Pipeline\nWhile R analyses can be directly incorporated into the pipeline, Julia code requires some extra steps.

In that case, define Julia’s path in .Renviron:\n\n\n.Renviron\n\nPATH_JULIA=/path/to/julia/\n\nAnd load it in .Rprofile:\n\n\n.Rprofile\n\nsource(\"renv/activate.R\")\nSys.setenv(\n  PATH = paste(Sys.getenv(\"PATH_JULIA\"), Sys.getenv(\"PATH\"), sep = \":\")\n)"

Over recent decades, high-income countries have experienced two notable shifts in household and family dynamics. First, there has been a significant decline in marriage rates and fertility. Second, time has increasingly been allocated to leisure activities. This paper presents a unified model of marriage and fertility, incorporating intra-household bargaining dynamics. The model, calibrated using data from Japan between 2018 and 2022, is employed to assess the impact of leisure technology growth on marriage and fertility during 2005-2009. The findings highlight that leisure technology growth makes single life relatively more appealing compared to marriage and parenthood. The model explains 22.0% of the decline in marriage and 65.8% of the decrease in fertility."

We leverage plausibly random variations in the timing of the rollout of the program by employing recent developments in estimating staggered difference-in-differences strategies to more accurately identify the effect of the program.

    "text": "Japan ranks 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2023, well below many developed countries, and has one of the largest gender pay gaps among high-income countries. On the other hand, women’s labor force participation is high in Japan. However, women are much more likely to work in non-regular jobs, which are associated with lower wages and fewer hours. Men, in contrast, have regular, higher-paid jobs with long-hours requirements. In this paper, I build and estimate a model where couples jointly decide their occupations and working hours. Occupations differ in their flexibility. Regular jobs require long working hours, and hourly wages are a convex function of hours worked. Non-regular occupations have a linear mapping between hours worked and hourly wages. The model also allows for social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands.Given the inflexibility of regular jobs and social norms, women are more likely to choose non-regular jobs or not to work, and allocate a larger share of their hours for home production. The model can account for nearly all gaps in participation rates, occupational choices, and labor hours, along with 22.4% of the wage gap. Through the lens of the model, the inflexibility of regular jobs explains almost all the gaps in occupational choices and wages, while social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands account for all of the gap in the participation rate and half of the gap in hours worked."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Japan ranks 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2023, well below many developed countries, and has one of the largest gender pay gaps among high-income countries. On the other hand, women’s labor force participation is high in Japan. However, women are much more likely to work in non-regular jobs, which are associated with lower wages and fewer hours. Men, in contrast, have regular, higher-paid jobs with long-hours requirements. In this paper, I build and estimate a model where couples jointly decide their occupations and working hours. Occupations differ in their flexibility. Regular jobs require long working hours, and hourly wages are a convex function of hours worked. Non-regular occupations have a linear mapping between hours worked and hourly wages. The model also allows for social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands.Given the inflexibility of regular jobs and social norms, women are more likely to choose non-regular jobs or not to work, and allocate a larger share of their hours for home production.

If you are interested in how I make graphs and tables, please refer to my previous workshop \nAlso, why not Ubuntu or other images? This is because installing R and Rstudio on Linux is more complicated than installing Python or Julia.

However, it does not have renv, I manually install it in the Dockerfile. Only if you use geospatial packages, you may want to use rocker/geospatial instead.\nThe renv is the best package manager for R, in my opinion. You can record the packages you installed by renv::snapshot() in renv.lock file. Then, you can reproduce the same environment by renv::restore() in other computers. If you are interested in renv, please refer to my previous workshop.\n\n\nPython\nI usually use Python only for DVC, so I don’t care much about the version. I install the latest version that can be installed with apt. In case that I need to use Python for analysis (e.g., scraping or natural language processing), I manage the version of the packages by pip and requirements.txt.\n\npip install -r requirements.txt for installation\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt for recording\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I manage the packages by requirements.txt?\n\n\n\nAs of September 2023, I think the virtual environment of Python is in chaos. For example, there are various tools such as venv, anaconda, pyenv, poetry, and rye, and I don’t know which one is the best and long-lasting. To be honest, I think pip install -r requirements.txt and pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt are enough because we are building the environment with Docker. However, I am not a researcher mainly using Python, so please let me know if there is any misunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\nJulia\nYou can specify the version of Julia in the Dockerfile by ENV JULIA_MINOR_VERSION=1.9 and ENV JULIA_PATCH_VERSION=3. From my experience, Julia has been updated to be faster, but I have not encountered any bugs. Therefore, I usually specify the latest version and keep updating it during the project.\nFor the package management of Julia, I use Project.toml. The workflow is as follows.\n\nCreate an empty Project.toml file\nActivate the environment by Pkg.activate()\nInstall the packages by Pkg.add(\"Package Name\"), which automatically updates Project.toml\nWhen you clone the project, activate the environment by Pkg.activate() and install the packages by Pkg.instantiate()\n\n\n\nOther Softwares & Settings\n\nopenssh-client is required for SSH communication with GitHub from the container\nSince DVC is a Python package, I add ~/.pip/bin to the PATH\nI change the permission of the cached packages. This is because when you mount Docker Volumes, the packages are created with root permission, and you cannot write them with user permission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Git & GitHub in the container\n\n\n\nSince I work in the container environment, I want to run git pull and git push in the container. To do so, you need to move the SSH key for the GitHub from the host environment to the container. This can be done by adding the key to ssh-agent. With the Remote Containers feature, you can use the key inside of the container automatically. The settings are different for each host OS, so I recommend reading the section “Sharing Git credentials with your container” in the official documentation of Developping inside a container.\nI use Windows WSL as the host OS, so I add the following to ~/.bash_profile. The difference from the official documentation is that I added ssh-add at the end.\n\n\n~/.bash_profile\n\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nif [ -z \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" ]; then\n   # Check for a currently running instance of the agent\n   RUNNING_AGENT=\"`ps -ax | grep 'ssh-agent -s' | grep -v grep | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]'`\"\n   if [ \"$RUNNING_AGENT\" = \"0\" ]; then\n        # Launch a new instance of the agent\n        ssh-agent -s &&gt; $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent\n   fi\n   eval `cat $HOME/.ssh/ssh-agent`\nfi\nssh-add $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519\n\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - PYTHONUSERBASE=/home/rstudio/.pip\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - renv:/home/rstudio/.cache/R/renv\n            - pip:/home/rstudio/.pip\n            - julia:/home/rstudio/.julia\n            - TinyTeX:/home/rstudio/.TinyTeX\n            - fonts:/usr/share/fonts\nvolumes:\n  renv:\n    external: true\n  pip:\n    external: true\n  julia:\n    external: true\n  TinyTeX:\n    external: true\n  fonts:\n    external: true\nThe most important point is that I mount the renv cache to the host’s Docker Volumes. This means that once you install the R packages, they will be saved on the host side. Therefore, you don’t need to install R packages every time you build the Docker. Also, when you use Docker environments for multiple projects, you don’t need to install the same packages multiple times. The same is true for Julia, Python, and TinyTeX packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Docker Volumes?\n\n\n\nDocker Volumes is a mechanism for storing Docker container data on the host side. This allows you to keep the data even if you delete the container. Unlike the binding mount, the data is stored in hidden folders on the host side and optimized for Docker, so it is faster than the binding mount. When you use this template for the first time, you need to create Docker Volumes by the following command.\ndocker volume create renv\ndocker volume create pip\ndocker volume create julia\ndocker volume create TinyTeX\ndocker volume create fonts\nIn some articles on the Internet (including my previous post), the author binding-mounts package caches into the host area directly, such as ~/.cache/R/renv. This is not recommended since the file system of MacOS and Windows (except WSL2) is different from Linux (Docker). The bind mounts may significantly slow down the execution of the package."

    "text": "\\(\\LaTeX\\) Environment\nTo use \\(\\LaTeX\\) in Docker, you can install texlive with apt or use it as a separate service in docker-compose.yml. However, there is a very light and convenient package called tinytex in R2, so I will use it.\n\nWhat is TinyTeX?\nTinyTeX is a super lightweight distribution of \\(\\LaTeX\\). It automatically installs missing packages and compiles them, so you don’t need to install a large number of packages in advance to build a \\(\\LaTeX\\) environment. This is why TinyTeX is used by default when compiling PDFs with Rmarkdown or Quarto. This lightness is very compatible with the Docker environment, and it is also adopted in the rocker/verse image. In this template, I will use TinyTeX as the \\(\\LaTeX\\) compiler in VSCode. Also, the \\(\\LaTeX\\) packages installed at this time are cached in Docker Volumes.\n\n\nInstalling TinyTeX and Setting in VSCode\nWhen installing TinyTeX, there is an R command called tinytex::install_tinytex(). However, since I want to cache the packages installed with TinyTeX in Docker Volumes, I specify the installation folder as follows.\ntinytex::install_tinytex(dir = \"/home/rstudio/.TinyTeX\", force = TRUE)\nNote that once you install it in Docker Volumes, you don’t need to run this command again in other Docker projects.\nTo use TinyTeX as the \\(\\LaTeX\\) compiler in VSCode, edit settings.json as this. Note that if you set it in WORKSPACE_DIR/.vscode/settings.json, it will only be valid for this workspace. Since the .vscode/settings.json is often git-ignored in team projects, I have renamed it to _settings.json in the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy I don’t use Overleaf?\n\n\n\nOverleaf is probably the first candidate for \\(\\LaTeX\\) editors, however, I don’t use Overleaf for the following reasons.\n\nIn the free version, Overleaf cannot be linked with GitHub\nGitHub branches cannot be separated\nIf I want to modify the appearance of figures and tables in slides and papers, I have to upload them every time\nThe number of files is limited to a maximum of 2000 files per project\nSometimes the service goes down. This is fatal if it is before the deadline\nIt is a waste of time to use an editor that cannot use GitHub Copilot or any other AIs 🫠\n\nI think the setup with TinyTeX and VSCode’s LaTeX Workshop extension is not so difficult, and the compilation is (usually) faster on your local computer."

    "text": "Writing a Blog with Quarto\nQuarto is a tool that extends R Markdown, and since it runs in the background with knitr, you can use R Markdown features as they are. Also, by using jupyter as the background engine, you can handle other languages such as Python and Julia.1\nIn this article, I will explain the unique features of Quarto and how to set it up as a website. To learn more about Quarto Markdown syntax and basic features, please refer to the official documentation.\n\nDifferences from R Markdown\nQuarto can be written just like R Markdown, but the only difference is in the chunk options.\n\n\nR markdown\n\n```{r, include = FALSE}\nmdl &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\n```\n\n\n\nQuarto\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nmdl &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)\n```\n\nI think this is a good notation because it is just a comment from the perspective of code execution, and it allows them to coexist with other languages such as Python and Julia.\nOther notable features include Tabset Panel and Callout Blocks, which make it easier to read. Also, the notation for citations has become easier to understand.\n\n\nSetting up the Website\n\n_quarto.yml\nThis is a project-level configuration file. For details, please refer to the official documentation. My configuration file looks like this.\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n  preview: \n    port: 5556\n    browser: true\n    watch-inputs: true\n    navigate: true\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Quarto Research Blog\"\n  favicon: favicon.svg\n  navbar:\n    right:\n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-research-blog\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme:\n      - cosmo\n      - custom.scss\n\noutput-dir: docs: When hosting with GitHub Pages, you need to output HTML files to the docs directory. If you deploy with GitHub Actions, it doesn’t have to be docs\nfavicon: The favicon file. I often use the one from Icooon Mono\ntheme: You can choose a theme from Bootswatch\ncustom.scss: You can set the CSS. Quarto has pre-defined Sass Variables, so you can easily customize it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject’s Code Name\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch often goes in a different direction from the research question set at the beginning. Therefore, the name of the repository and the actual research may differ. Following Dr. Andrew Heiss’s idea, I give the project a code name that has nothing to do with the research.\nFor example, the project I researched gender gaps in Japan has the code name common cheetah. This is generated using the codename R package.\nlibrary(codename)\ncodename_message()\n#&gt; code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31).\n\ncodename(seed = 210715, type = \"ubuntu\") # The day I started the project\n#&gt; [1] \"common cheetah\"\nBy the way, with this Ubuntu-styling, an animal name is always assigned, so it’s easy to decide on a favicon.

    "section": "Adding Basic Authentication to AWS S3 + CloudFront",
    "text": "Adding Basic Authentication to AWS S3 + CloudFront\nBy using AWS S3 and CloudFront, you can publish a website with password authentication (Basic authentication) at a relatively low cost (about tens of cents per month). Please note that AWS specifications and pricing may change, so please follow the steps below at your own risk.\n\nCreate an S3 Bucket and Automatically Deploy with GitHub Actions\n\nStep 1: Create an S3 Bucket\nCreate a bucket from S3 in the AWS console. It is easy to understand if the bucket name is the same as the GitHub repository. The settings can be left as default. Since access is via CloudFront, block all public access to the bucket.\n\n\nStep 2: Create an IAM User and Get the Access Key\nCreate a user from IAM in the AWS console and give it full access to S3 (AmazonS3FullAccess) as the policy. Then, get the access key and save it in a safe place.\n\n\nStep 3: Register the Access Key in GitHub Secrets\nOpen the repository’s Settings from GitHub and register AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY as new repository secrets.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Deploy with GitHub Actions\nBy setting up GitHub Actions as follows, HTML files are automatically deployed to the S3 bucket when pushed to the main branch.\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Quarto Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: Render Quarto Project\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render@v2\n      \n      - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1\n        with:\n          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n          aws-region: us-west-2\n\n      - name: S3 sync\n        working-directory: docs\n        run: aws s3 sync . s3://quarto-research-blog --delete\n\n\n\n\nSet Basic Authentication with CloudFront\nYou can set a password with Basic authentication by accessing the S3 bucket via CloudFront.\n\nStep 1: Create a CloudFront Function\nFrom the AWS console, create a function from CloudFront → Functions → Create function.\nfunction handler(event) {\n  var request = event.request;\n  var headers = request.headers;\n  var uri = request.uri;\n\n  // echo -n user:pass | base64\n  var authString = \"Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\";\n\n  if (\n    typeof headers.authorization === \"undefined\" ||\n    headers.authorization.value !== authString\n  ) {\n    return {\n      statusCode: 401,\n      statusDescription: \"Unauthorized\",\n      headers: { \"www-authenticate\": { value: \"Basic\" } }\n    };\n  }\n  \n  // Check whether the URI is missing a file name.\n    if (uri.endsWith('/')) {\n        request.uri += 'index.html';\n    }\n    // Check whether the URI is missing a file extension.\n    else if (!uri.includes('.')) {\n        request.uri += '/index.html';\n    }\n  \n  return request;\n}\nIn the authString, set the base64-encoded username and password. For example, if you have a username abcd and password 1234 like the demo site, you can encode it with echo -n abcd:1234 | base64. You can encode it in CloudShell at the bottom left of the AWS console.\nIn the latter half of the code, index.html is added if the URL ends with / or if there is no extension. The index.html in the subdirectory is not displayed when accessing the S3 bucket via CloudFront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to publish the function you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP Address Restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to increase security, you can restrict access by IP address. In the case of universities and companies, you often have a fixed IP address, so it should be relatively easy to set up. Enter the allowed IP addresses in IP_WHITE_LIST.\nfunction handler(event) {\n  var request = event.request;\n  var clientIP = event.viewer.ip;\n  var headers = request.headers;\n  var uri = request.uri;\n  \n  //-------------------\n  // Check IP\n  //-------------------\n  var IP_WHITE_LIST = [\n   'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx',\n  ];\n    \n  var isPermittedIp = IP_WHITE_LIST.includes(clientIP);\n  \n  if (!isPermittedIp) {\n    var response = {\n        statusCode: 403,\n        statusDescription: 'Forbidden',\n    }\n    return response;\n  }\n  \n  //---------------------------\n  // Basic Authentication\n  //---------------------------\n  \n  // echo -n user:pass | base64\n  var authString = \"Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\";\n\n  if (\n    typeof headers.authorization === \"undefined\" ||\n    headers.authorization.value !== authString\n  ) {\n    return {\n      statusCode: 401,\n      statusDescription: \"Unauthorized\",\n      headers: { \"www-authenticate\": { value: \"Basic\" } }\n    };\n  }\n  \n  //--------------------------------------\n  // Correct Subdirectory index.html\n  //-------------------------------------\n  \n  // Check whether the URI is missing a file name.\n    if (uri.endsWith('/')) {\n        request.uri += 'index.html';\n    }\n    // Check whether the URI is missing a file extension.\n    else if (!uri.includes('.')) {\n        request.uri += '/index.html';\n    }\n  \n  return request;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution\nCreate a distribution from CloudFront in the AWS console.\n\nOrigin Domain Name: Select the S3 bucket you created earlier\nOrigin Access\n\nSelect Origin access control settings\nCreate a new OAC\n\nViewer: Select Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\nAssociate Function: Select CloudFront Functions and select the function you created earlier\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): If enabled, it will incur a fee. I think it is unnecessary this time\nSupported HTTP Versions: I selected HTTP/2 and HTTP/3\nDefault Root Object: Select index.html\n\n\n\nStep 3: Change the S3 Bucket Policy\nAfter completing the above, you will be asked to update the S3 bucket policy.\n\nPress the Copy Policy button and copy the Policy Statement\nSelect the S3 bucket, edit the bucket policy from the Permissions tab, and paste the policy statement you copied earlier\n\n\n\nStep 4: Test\nCopy the distribution domain name from the CloudFront distribution and access it in your browser. You will be asked for a password, and by entering the username and password you set earlier, the blog should be displayed.\n\n\n\nOptional: Setting up a Subdomain\nIf you have your own domain, you can create a subdomain for free to have your own URL. I have a domain kazuyanagimoto.com that I acquired from Google Domains, so I can create up to 100 subdomains for free.\n\nStep 1: Create a Subdomain\nCreate a subdomain from the DNS settings of your domain. In the case of this demo site, create a CNAME record for the subdomain quarto-research-blog.kazuyanagimoto.com and set the CloudFront distribution domain name (without https://).\n\n\nStep 2: Create a Custom SSL Certificate\nCreate a custom SSL certificate from AWS Certificate Manager. Select the public certificate request. Add your domain and subdomain to the domain name. It is recommended to use a wildcard for the subdomain like *.kazuyanagimoto.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nYou must use the us-east-1 region for AWS Certificate Manager to use it with CloudFront.\n\n\nIf you select DNS validation, you will need to add a DNS record to your domain’s DNS settings. A CNAME record starting with _ will be displayed, so add it to your domain’s DNS settings. After registration is complete, the status of the certificate should change to published.\n\n\nStep 3: Set the CloudFront Distribution Alternate Domain Name\nReturn to CloudFront and set the alternate domain name for the distribution. As the alternate domain name, enter the subdomain you created earlier, and select the custom SSL certificate you created earlier.\n\n\nStep 4: Test\nAccess the subdomain. You will be asked for a password, and by entering the username and password you set earlier, the blog should be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto Research Blog - Researching as if to Blog \nusername: abcd, password: 1234"

    "text": "Plots\n\nTheme\nMinimizing elements is a starting point of slide design. For that purpose, it is important to use the same fonts and colors for figures (and tables) as the slides. This is the reason why I used to use xaringanthemer, which automatically generates the ggplot2 theme corresponding to the slides’ theme. Unfortunately, there have been no packages for Quarto slides (as far as I know), I declare this theme_quarto() function.\n\n\nCode\nblend_colors &lt;- function(x, y, alpha = 0.5) {\n  x &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(x)\n  y &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(y)\n  z &lt;- colorspace::mixcolor(alpha, x, y)\n  colorspace::hex(z)\n}\ncolor_blender &lt;- function(x, y) function(alpha = 0.5) blend_colors(x, y, alpha)\ntheme_quarto &lt;- function(\n  text_color = color_text,\n  background_color = color_bg,\n  text_font = font_text,\n  text_font_size = 30,\n  accent_color = color_base,\n  title_font = font_title,\n  title_font_size = 30\n) {\n  blend &lt;- color_blender(text_color, background_color)\n  ggplot2::theme(\n    line = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.2)),\n    rect = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = background_color),\n    title = ggplot2::element_text(\n      color = accent_color,\n      family = title_font,\n      size = title_font_size\n    ),\n    plot.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n      fill = background_color,\n      color = background_color\n    ),\n    panel.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n      fill = background_color,\n      color = background_color\n    ),\n    panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_line(\n      color = blend(0.8),\n      inherit.blank = TRUE\n    ),\n    panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_line(\n      color = blend(0.9),\n      inherit.blank = TRUE\n    ),\n    axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8),\n    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.8)),\n    axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(\n      color = blend(0.4),\n      size = title_font_size * 0.7\n    ),\n    legend.key = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n    legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(\n      size = title_font_size * 0.8,\n      family = title_font\n    ),\n    plot.caption = ggplot2::element_text(\n      size = text_font_size * 0.8,\n      color = blend(0.3)\n    )\n  )\n}\n\n\nWhile the original xaringanthemer::theme_xaringan() redefines the primary color of ggplot2::geom_* by ggplot2::update_geom_defaults, my function does not. I did not overwrite it because color palettes must be specified manually for 2+ color cases, anyway. You can use it like:\n\ncolor_base &lt;- \"#1C5253\"\ntb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe most famous way to highlight plots should be gghighlight. You can proceed with your stories smoothly and clearly by\n\n\n\nFirst Slide\n\np &lt;- tb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_col(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Slide\n\np + gghighlight(x == \"Japan\")"

You can solve it by\nkableExtra::kbl(data, format=\"markdown\")\nbut it contains the abovementioned disadvantages of markdown tables.\nThen, I compromise by using\n\nUnicode Greek letters (θ, τ, δ, etc.)\nHTML tags (&lt;sup&gt; and &lt;sub&gt;)\n\nand evaluating them by gt::fmt_markdown(). Mathematical expressions in tables are usually simple, so I don’t have any problems so far.\n\ntibble(a = c(\"θ = 0\", \"τ&lt;sup&gt;δ-1&lt;/sup&gt;\")) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  fmt_markdown(columns = everything())\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe gt package itself can also highlight cells in a table with the function tab_style(). However, this requires redundant writing, so gtExtras::gt_highlight_rows() and gtExtras::gt_highlight_cols() are useful if you want to highlight row/column-wise."

So you can easily carry it around like a PDF file.3\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    standalone: true\n    embed-resources: true\nHowever, you will be asked to submit your slides in PDF format in various situations.
