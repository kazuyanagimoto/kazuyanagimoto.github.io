If your environment includes python, it is easier to install it via pip.\n\n\nR packages\nI use renv for dependency management. languageserver allows us to run a code in VSCode, but I don’t usually use it.\n\n\nRstudio Global Options\nWhen Rstudio launches, it loads the ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json file for general settings. So I prepare /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json, and it allows me to use Rstudio with my favorite settings.\nIf you want to use your own settings, I recommend you\n\nOpen Rstudio\nSet up by GUI (Tools -&gt; Global Options)\nCopy ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in container)\nPaste it on /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in host)\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - RENV_PATHS_CACHE=/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - $HOME/.renv:/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n\nDISABLE_AUTH=true\nYou don’t need to type a password for each new session.\n\n\nCache for renv\nBy setting the RENV_PATH_CACHE and mounting the directory, you don’t need to re-install packages. In other words, you can share packages with other (docker) projects and don’t have to re-install all the packages when you rebuild a container.\nHave fun!"

    "text": "The other day, I used slides made with Quarto in a presentation at a conference. In the Economics community, 98% of people use Beamer of \\(\\LaTeX\\), and about 2% use PowerPoint for their presentations. I personally don’t like Beamer’s design, and I think PowerPoint has a problem with maintainability (i.e., can it be easily changed) in case of ongoing projects. I like Quarto for the following reasons:\n\nReasonably good design. And highly customizable.\nTime saving. Slides are written in the markdown notation, so you can make it with the same amount of effort as Beamer (unless you care about the design😉)\nEasily maintainable. Variables can be used in the text, so the numbers are automatically updated even if the model or analysis is slightly changed.\n\nHere, I write some tips on Quarto for academic presentations. For the basic slide creation in Quarto, please refer to the official documentation or Tom Mock’s slides at the RStudio conference. The slides used at the conference presentation are not yet ready for public release, so I prepare these example slides\n\n Slides    PDF    Code"

Unfortunately, there have been no packages for Quarto slides (as far as I know), I declare this theme_quarto() function.\n\n\nCode\nblend_colors &lt;- function(x, y, alpha = 0.5) {\n  x &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(x)\n  y &lt;- colorspace::hex2RGB(y)\n  z &lt;- colorspace::mixcolor(alpha, x, y)\n  colorspace::hex(z)\n}\ncolor_blender &lt;- function(x, y) function(alpha = 0.5) blend_colors(x, y, alpha)\ntheme_quarto &lt;- function (\n    text_color = color_text,\n    background_color = color_bg,\n    text_font = font_text,\n    text_font_size = 30,\n    accent_color = color_base,\n    title_font = font_title,\n    title_font_size = 30\n){\n    blend &lt;- color_blender(text_color, background_color)\n    ggplot2::theme(\n        line = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.2)),\n        rect = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = background_color),\n        title = ggplot2::element_text(\n            color = accent_color,\n            family = title_font,\n            size = title_font_size\n        ),\n        plot.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.8),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.9),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8),\n        axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.8)),\n        axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(color = blend(0.4), size = title_font_size * 0.7),\n        legend.key = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n        legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8, family = title_font),\n        plot.caption = ggplot2::element_text(\n            size = text_font_size * 0.8,\n            color = blend(0.3)\n        )\n    )\n}\n\n\nWhile the original xaringanthemer::theme_xaringan() redefines the primary color of ggplot2::geom_* by ggplot2::update_geom_defaults, my function does not. I did not overwrite it because color palettes must be specified manually for 2+ color cases, anyway. You can use it like:\n\ncolor_base &lt;- \"#1C5253\"\ntb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe most famous way to highlight plots should be gghighlight. You can proceed with your stories smoothly and clearly by\n\n\n\nFirst Slide\n\np &lt;- tb_hoge |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_col(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Slide\n\np + gghighlight(x == \"Japan\")"

In the Economics community, 98% of people use Beamer of \\(\\LaTeX\\), and about 2% use PowerPoint for their presentations. I personally don’t like Beamer’s design, and I think PowerPoint has a problem with maintainability (i.e., can it be easily changed) in case of ongoing projects. I like Quarto for the following reasons:\n\nReasonably good design. And highly customizable.\nTime saving. Slides are written in the markdown notation, so you can make it with the same amount of effort as Beamer (unless you care about the design😉)\nEasily maintainable. Variables can be used in the text, so the numbers are automatically updated even if the model or analysis is slightly changed.\n\nHere, I write some tips on Quarto for academic presentations. For the basic slide creation in Quarto, please refer to the official documentation or Tom Mock’s slides at the RStudio conference. The slides used at the conference presentation are not yet ready for public release, so I prepare these example slides\n\n Slides    PDF    Code"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nJapan ranks 116th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2022, well below many developing countries, and has one of the largest gender pay gaps among high-income countries. On the other hand, women’s labor force participation is high in Japan. However, women are much more likely to work in non-regular jobs, which are associated with lower wages and fewer hours. Men, in contrast, have regular, higher-paid jobs with long-hours requirements. In this paper, I build and estimate a model in which couples jointly decide their occupations and working hours. Occupations differ in their flexibility. Regular ones require long working hours, and hourly wages are convex functions of hours worked. Non-regular occupations have a linear mapping between hours worked and hourly wages. The model also allows for social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands. Given the inflexibility of regular jobs and social norms, women are more likely to choose non-regular jobs or not to work, and allocate a larger share of their hours for home production for their households. The model can account for all the observed gender gaps in labor force participation, 33% in occupational choices, 74% in labor hours, and 34% in wages. Through the lens of the model, the inflexibility of regular jobs explains almost all the gaps in occupational choices and wages, while social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands account for all the gap in the participation rate and half of the gap in hours worked."

Indeed, Jupyter cannot use multiple languages within a document, and we usually use the jupyter engine for Python and Julia (and it is officially supported.)\nHowever, knitr has already been able to execute multiple languages tons of years ago, so why can’t we do it in Quarto?\nLet’s see the following example with palmerpenguins::penguins of Horst, Hill, and Gorman (2020)"

    "text": "Abstract\nJapan ranks 116th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2022, well below many developing countries, and has one of the largest gender pay gaps among high-income countries. On the other hand, women’s labor force participation is high in Japan. However, women are much more likely to work in non-regular jobs, which are associated with lower wages and fewer hours. Men, in contrast, have regular, higher-paid jobs with long-hours requirements. In this paper, I build and estimate a model in which couples jointly decide their occupations and working hours. Occupations differ in their flexibility. Regular ones require long working hours, and hourly wages are convex functions of hours worked. Non-regular occupations have a linear mapping between hours worked and hourly wages. The model also allows for social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands. Given the inflexibility of regular jobs and social norms, women are more likely to choose non-regular jobs or not to work, and allocate a larger share of their hours for home production for their households. The model can account for all the observed gender gaps in labor force participation, 33% in occupational choices, 74% in labor hours, and 34% in wages. Through the lens of the model, the inflexibility of regular jobs explains almost all the gaps in occupational choices and wages, while social norms that penalize women who earn more than their husbands account for all the gap in the participation rate and half of the gap in hours worked."
