    "text": "Brief Explanations\nIn this section, I briefly comment on each files. I assume you are familiar with\n\nR, Rstudio & renv\nDocker\nVSCode and its Remote-Containers extension\n\nI manage data files by DVC. But if you have another strategy for the data management, ignore these parts.\n\nDockerfile\nFROM rocker/verse\n\nRUN apt update && apt install -y gnupg openssh-client libpoppler-cpp-dev\n\n# DVC\nRUN wget \\\n       https://dvc.org/deb/dvc.list \\\n       -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dvc.list && \\\n    wget -qO - https://dvc.org/deb/iterative.asc | apt-key add - && \\\n    apt update && \\\n    apt install -y dvc \n\n# R Packages\nRUN R -e \"install.packages(c('languageserver', 'renv'))\"\n\n# Rstudio Global Options\nCOPY --chown=rstudio:rstudio .config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json /home/rstudio/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json\n\nR image\nIf you don’t have any preferences, I recommend you to use one of the rocker image series of rocker-org:\n\nrocker/rstudio\nrocker/tidyverse\nrocker/verse\nrocker/geospatial\n\nBecause I currently write a paper by Rmarkdown, I usually use rocker/verse and use rocker/geospatial for spatial analysis.\n\n\nDVC\nI have just follow the official guide for Install from repository. If your environment includes python, it is easier to install it via pip.\n\n\nR packages\nI use renv for dependency management. languageserver allows us to run a code in VSCode, but I don’t usually use it.\n\n\nRstudio Global Options\nWhen Rstudio launches, it loads the ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json file for general settings. So I prepare /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json, and it allows me to use Rstudio with my favorites settings.\nIf you want to use your own settings, I recommend you\n\nOpen Rstudio\nSet up by GUI (Tools -> Global Options)\nCopy ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in container)\nPaste it on /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in host)\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - RENV_PATHS_CACHE=/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - $HOME/.renv:/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n\nDISABLE_AUTH=true\nYou don’t need to type a password for each new session.\n\n\nCache for renv\nBy setting the RENV_PATH_CACHE and mount the directory, you don’t need to re-install packages. In other words, you can share packages with other (docker) projects and don’t have to re-install all the packages when you rebuild a container.\nHave fun!"
