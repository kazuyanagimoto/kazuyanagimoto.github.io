If your environment includes python, it is easier to install it via pip.\n\n\nR packages\nI use renv for dependency management. languageserver allows us to run a code in VSCode, but I don’t usually use it.\n\n\nRstudio Global Options\nWhen Rstudio launches, it loads the ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json file for general settings. So I prepare /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json, and it allows me to use Rstudio with my favorite settings.\nIf you want to use your own settings, I recommend you\n\nOpen Rstudio\nSet up by GUI (Tools -> Global Options)\nCopy ~/.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in container)\nPaste it on /.config/rstudio/rstudio-prefs.json (in host)\n\n\n\n\ndocker-compose.yml\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    rstudio:\n        build:\n            context: .\n        environment:\n            - TZ=Europe/Madrid\n            - DISABLE_AUTH=true\n            - RENV_PATHS_CACHE=/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n        volumes:\n            - .:/home/rstudio/work\n            - $HOME/.renv:/home/rstudio/.renv/cache\n\nDISABLE_AUTH=true\nYou don’t need to type a password for each new session.\n\n\nCache for renv\nBy setting the RENV_PATH_CACHE and mounting the directory, you don’t need to re-install packages. In other words, you can share packages with other (docker) projects and don’t have to re-install all the packages when you rebuild a container.\nHave fun!"

    "text": "The other day, I used slides made with Quarto in a presentation at a conference. In the Economics community, 98% of people use Beamer of \\(\\LaTeX\\), and about 2% use PowerPoint for their presentations. I personally don’t like Beamer’s design, and I think PowerPoint has a problem with maintainability (i.e., can it be easily changed) in case of ongoing projects. I like Quarto for the following reasons:\n\nReasonably good design. And highly customizable.\nTime saving. Slides are written in the markdown notation, so you can make it with the same amount of effort as Beamer (unless you care about the design😉)\nEasily maintainable. Variables can be used in the text, so the numbers are automatically updated even if the model or analysis is slightly changed.\n\nHere, I write some tips on Quarto for academic presentations. For the basic slide creation in Quarto, please refer to the official documentation or Tom Mock’s slides at the RStudio conference. The slides used at the conference presentation are not yet ready for public release, so I prepare these example slides\n\n Slides    PDF    Code"

This is the reason why I used to use xaringanthemer, which automatically generates the ggplot2 theme corresponding to the slides’ theme. Unfortunately, there have been no packages for Quarto slides (as far as I know), I declare this theme_quarto() function.\n\n\nCode\nblend_colors <- function(x, y, alpha = 0.5) {\n  x <- colorspace::hex2RGB(x)\n  y <- colorspace::hex2RGB(y)\n  z <- colorspace::mixcolor(alpha, x, y)\n  colorspace::hex(z)\n}\ncolor_blender <- function(x, y) function(alpha = 0.5) blend_colors(x, y, alpha)\ntheme_quarto <- function (\n    text_color = color_text,\n    background_color = color_bg,\n    text_font = font_text,\n    text_font_size = 30,\n    accent_color = color_base,\n    title_font = font_title,\n    title_font_size = 30\n){\n    blend <- color_blender(text_color, background_color)\n    ggplot2::theme(\n        line = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.2)),\n        rect = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = background_color),\n        title = ggplot2::element_text(\n            color = accent_color,\n            family = title_font,\n            size = title_font_size\n        ),\n        plot.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.background = ggplot2::element_rect(\n            fill = background_color,\n            color = background_color\n        ),\n        panel.grid.major = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.8),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        panel.grid.minor = ggplot2::element_line(\n            color = blend(0.9),\n            inherit.blank = TRUE\n        ),\n        axis.title = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8),\n        axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_line(color = blend(0.8)),\n        axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(color = blend(0.4), size = title_font_size * 0.7),\n        legend.key = ggplot2::element_rect(fill = \"transparent\", colour = NA),\n        legend.text = ggplot2::element_text(size = title_font_size * 0.8, family = title_font),\n        plot.caption = ggplot2::element_text(\n            size = text_font_size * 0.8,\n            color = blend(0.3)\n        )\n    )\n}\n\n\nWhile the original xaringanthemer::theme_xaringan() redefines the primary color of ggplot2::geom_* by ggplot2::update_geom_defaults, my function does not. I did not overwrite it because color palettes must be specified manually for 2+ color cases, anyway. You can use it like:\n\ncolor_base <- \"#1C5253\"\ntb_hoge |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_point(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe most famous way to highlight plots should be gghighlight. You can proceed with your stories smoothly and clearly by\n\n\n\nFirst Slide\n\np <- tb_hoge |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_col(color = color_base) +\n  theme_quarto()\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Slide\n\np + gghighlight(x == \"Japan\")"

You can solve it by\nkableExtra::kbl(data, format=\"markdown\")\nbut it contains the abovementioned disadvantages of markdown tables.\nThen, I compromise by using\n\nUnicode Greek letters (θ, τ, δ, etc.)\nHTML tags (<sup> and <sub>)\n\nand evaluating them by gt::fmt_markdown(). Mathematical expressions in tables are usually simple, so I don’t have any problems so far.\n\ntibble(a = c(\"θ = 0\", \"τ<sup>δ-1</sup>\")) |>\n  gt() |>\n  fmt_markdown(columns = everything())\n\n\n\nHighlighting\nThe gt package itself can also highlight cells in a table with the function tab_style(). However, this requires redundant writing, so gtExtras::gt_highlight_rows() and gtExtras::gt_highlight_cols() are useful if you want to highlight row/column-wise."

So you can easily carry it around like a PDF file.3\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    standalone: true\n    embed-resources: true\nHowever, you will be asked to submit your slides in PDF format in various situations. And whether or not you actually present your presentation in PDF format, it is a good idea to have PDF slides on hand for insurance purposes.\n\nOpen the HTML file in your browser and press E\nClick “Print” on the browser, then “Save as PDF”\n\nIf you want to separate fragments, specify pdf-separate-fragments: true in YAML.\n\n\nProblems with Hyperlink\nA hyperlink that jumps to each slide is essentially a reference to an <h2> tag, so the link can be written as:\n## A Slide {#sec-slide}\n\n<a href=\"#/sec-detail\">detail↗</a>\n\n## A Detail Slide {#sec-detail}\n\n<a href=\"#/sec-slide\">↩︎</a>\nHowever, as far as I know, the link is not reflected in the above PDF output. If anyone knows a solution to this problem, I would appreciate it if you could let me know."

    "text": "Are You a Beamer Fan?\nThe other day, I used slides made with Quarto in a presentation at a conference. In the Economics community, 98% of people use Beamer of \\(\\LaTeX\\), and about 2% use PowerPoint for their presentations. I personally don’t like Beamer’s design, and I think PowerPoint has a problem with maintainability (i.e., can it be easily changed) in case of ongoing projects. I like Quarto for the following reasons:\n\nReasonably good design. And highly customizable.\nTime saving. Slides are written in the markdown notation, so you can make it with the same amount of effort as Beamer (unless you care about the design😉)\nEasily maintainable. Variables can be used in the text, so the numbers are automatically updated even if the model or analysis is slightly changed.\n\nHere, I write some tips on Quarto for academic presentations. For the basic slide creation in Quarto, please refer to the official documentation or Tom Mock’s slides at the RStudio conference. The slides used at the conference presentation are not yet ready for public release, so I prepare these example slides\n\n Slides    PDF    Code"
